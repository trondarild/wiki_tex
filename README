wiki_tex converts LaTeX documents to a form that can be easily
imported into MediaWiki.  Useage is:


python wiki_tex.py tatkappa | python3.11 add_citations.py refs.bib > out_with_citations.txt

This loads filename.tex and converts it into a file or files that can
be used as input to a MediaWiki.  By default, the program parses
everything between \begin{document} and \end{document}, and puts the
output into filename0.wiki.  However, it also has an option to output
multiple files.  To invoke this option, simply insert the line:

%#break

into your LaTeX code wherever you want a new output.  This will
generate articles filename0.wiki, filename1.wiki, and so on.  It
starts conversion wherver the first occurrence of %#break is.

The program is very simple.  It's a quick and dirty kludge, intended
to ease the process of importing into MediaWiki, not a full-fledged
converter.  With that in mind, I hope it's useful.
